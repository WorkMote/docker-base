A new user account is created to access container when running. root account access is not recommended.
Many might say it's safe because only you have access to it, and it can be the case, but the thing
is using root creates a sense of "that as the right thing", and that's simply not true. Need to fix
this using-root-is-fine culture before it gets too late (no, no, nothing about SkyNet... Maybe).
Never use root account for normal tasks.
